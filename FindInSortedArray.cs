// given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times. 
// Write a code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was 
// originally sorted in increasing order.
//Example:
//	Input: find 5 in (15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14)
//	Output: 8 (index of 5 in array)

// !- First idea will be to iterate and get index when item found O(n)
// !- Whats the size of the rotation? if it's half:
